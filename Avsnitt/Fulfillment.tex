\section{Fulfillment of the goal}
This section will discuss the fulfillments of goals in the project.

\subsection{Summary of achievements}
The product can receive audio and change the volume and balance settings. This is far from all the goals we had with the project. The FIR filters does not work, even after extensive troubleshooting. We have also tested to implement another, simpler, FIR algorithm. This did not work either, which is strange. We finished the FIR filters about a week and a half before the codec, all our testbenches gives us what we expect, but it does not filter audio as expected. This gave us very little time to troubleshoot.

\subsection{How the delivery worked out}
The final presentation went as good as it could with what we had. Hopefully we can still get a passing grade.

\subsection{How the study situation influenced the project}
The whole course TSTE12 takes up alot more time than it should, i have been tracking all my time spent on all courses for a couple of years now and this course takes up a bigger percentage than it should. During this course of 6hp, i have been taking one other course of 6hp and one of 3hp. So this course should have taken up 40\% of my time, but instead it has taken 72\%.
