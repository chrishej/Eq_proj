\section{Summary}
In summary this project is not a success in its ability to fulfill requirements. I have learned alot of VHDL though, 

\subsection{Three most important experiences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Read up on two:s complement fix-point representation.
  \item Try to put as much time as possible on the design specification, even though the time to deadline is short.
  \item Having clear and open communication within the group is very important. Daniel and I read a lot about two:s complement fix-point representation, and brought it up to the group early which made their job easier since they did not have to spend the time reading about it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Good advice to those who are going to perform a similar project}
The three points above are important. Using git worked well, but if i would do it again i would put one group member to read up on SVN and becoming responsible for it. Version control is an important skill to learn. 

Our FIR filters are more complicated than they need to be, i would recommend reading more about filter design in VHDL before implementation.
