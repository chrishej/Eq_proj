\section{Time report}
In this section the time spent on different activities will be shown. 
\subsection{Time report over spent time}
In table \ref{tab:time} the time spent on different activities is shown.

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{Time spent on activities.}
  \label{tab:time}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Activity} & \textbf{Used time (hours)} \\ \hline
    FIR implementation & 36.5 \\ \hline
    Design specification & 15 \\ \hline
    Final report & 10 \\ \hline
    Requirement specification & 6.5 \\ \hline
    Assisting other teams & 6.5 \\ \hline
    Meetings & 4 \\ \hline
    Administrative & 3.5 \\ \hline
    Preparing presentation & 2.5 \\ \hline
    Project and time plan & 2.5 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

\subsection{Comparison between planned and spent time}
In table \ref{tab:time_comp} a comparison between the planned time and the used time for activities is shown.
\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{Time spent on activities compared with planned time.}
  \label{tab:time_comp}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Activity} & \textbf{Planned time (hours)} & \textbf{Used time (hours)} \\ \hline
      FIR filters & 42 & 36.5 \\ \hline
      Meetings & 2.5 & 4 \\ \hline
      Design specification & 8 & 15 \\ \hline
      Project and time plan & 4 & 2.5 \\ \hline
      Final report & 6 & 10 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

\subsection{Individual design contribution}
Daniel and I have created the FIR filters. I have also helped on the other subsystems.
